# BestRouteProblem
A delivery executive is standing idle somewhere when suddenly his phone rings
and notifies that heâ€™s just been assigned a batch of 2 orders meant to
be delivered in the shortest possible timeframe.

Since there are multiple ways to go about delivering these orders, 
this code helps him figure out the best way to finish the batch in 
the shortest possible time.
